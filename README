Tiling window management that sucks less - see http://wmii.suckless.org/
This emulates wmii in Vim as much as possible. A dwm emulation might come next.

For the window management, all shortcuts use the <Alt> (Meta) key by default:
       Alt+[sdf]  => tiling mode selection: [s]tacked, [d]ivided, [f]ullscreen
       Alt+[hjkl] => select adjacent window
       Alt+[HJKL] => move current window
  Ctrl+Alt+[hjkl] => resize current window

This implies that:
  1/ you're not using <Alt> as main modifier in your dwm/wmii/i3 window manager
     -- I'd suggest to use the <Super> (win) key for your WM instead
  2/ your <Alt> key is enabled in your Vim session:
     -- if your <Alt> key sends <Esc> instead of setting the 8th bit, please
        uncomment the related shortcuts in the suckless.vim script.
     -- if you're running gVim, a quick and dirty way to free <Alt>-* shortcuts
        is to disable all menus:  set guioptions-=m
     -- if you're runing MacVim, you'll have to set the 'macmeta' pref to enable
        Option keys as "Meta" (MacVim â‰¥ 7.3 required)
     -- if you're running MacVim and want to keep one Option key, this patch
        should be useful: https://gist.github.com/666875
  3/ if you're not pleased with <Alt>-* shortcuts, you'll have to define your
     own shortcuts directly in the suckless.vim file. :-/

Vim tabs are used as "views":
  Alt+[0..9]      => select tab [1..10]
  <Leader>[0..9]  => select tab [1..10]
  <Leader>t[0..9] => move current window to tab [1..10]
  <Leader>T[0..9] => copy current window to tab [1..10]

This is my very first Vim plugin, so there should be a bunch of mistakes...
